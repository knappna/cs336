6.1
a. Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above.
If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case. List the Curl commands you used successfully.

Methods besides GET cannot be tested with chrome because it does not have access, but chrome works for GET because that is what allows it
to serve up webpates. Meanwhile, all four others (HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE) along with GET also work with curl.

Successful curl:
curl -X GET localhost:3000/request
curl -X PUT localhost:3000/request
curl -X POST localhost:3000/request
curl -X DELETE localhost:3000/request

I recieved this error when trying the HEAD method with curl...
nak7@gold21:~/cs336/lab06/app$ curl -X HEAD localhost:3000/request
Warning: Setting custom HTTP method to HEAD with -X/--request may not work the 
Warning: way you want. Consider using -I/--head instead.
curl: (18) transfer closed with 147 bytes remaining to read

b. What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?
HTTP code 500 - Server Error because the pages not defined by an Express route are not able to be served up by the Express server, therefore there is a server error.

6.2
a. What HTTP methods do forms support?
HTTP request methods GET and POST are the only ones supported by forms.

b. How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take? Is the data modified in any way?
Data is passed to the server as a string which is parsed to turn the data into a list of key and value pairs once it reaches the server.
