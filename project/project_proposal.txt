Project Proposal

For my project, I would like to really delve into understanding and becoming more adept at using 
CSS to create a professionally designed webpage. With this in mind, my project idea is to design 
a webpage that acts similarly Etsy or any other small business webpage. The page would include 
a number of products for “sale,” including their descriptions, prices, and a picture of the objects 
for sale. The webpage would allow the user to “add to cart” at which point the object (or the 
count of the object) would decrease by one and the number of products in the cart would increase 
by one. Clicking on the cart would allow the user of my project to view the items stored there 
(which they selected). I would focus on using CSS to make this page look as professional and 
creative as possible. To do this I would integrate the strategies and CSS alterations detailed in 
Lab 6, as well as some new techniques and designs from other CSS literature. I would also like 
to take a stab at incorporating flexbox and so that my webpage would look good and be easily 
useable on mobile devices of variable screen sizes as well. Obviously, I would also make use of
 the things I learned about HTML and JavaScript through previous labs. To add to the complexity 
 of this project I would like to incorporate some of the ideas listed in the suggested 
project online. I like the idea of linking in outside sites and other materials like images and 
videos. These types of things could be added in the product descriptions of the things for sale in 
my fake small business webpage.

If possible, I would like to work with Lydia Holtrop on this project as she is the only person I 
know in this class.
