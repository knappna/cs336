a. Explain:
i: The component structure of this app is as follows (with tabbed elements being nested in elements above)
- CommentBox
  - CommentList
    - Comment
  - CommentForm
The UI is composable in that it allows us to return a tree of components that we have built instead of a basic HTML. 
In other words, React allows the combination of components into a unit of functionality as a component tree.
This is important because it allows for easy maintance at the frontend of the code - there are fewer bugs and overall
composition is easier.
ii. JSX acts as a precompiler that translates "syntactic sugar" into plain JavaScript code. It automatically rewrites 
HTML tages as JavaScript which allows us to use the concise and familar syntax of JSX to define the tree structures.
iii. ReactJS is usable with XSS because React is 'safe' meaning that it does not generate HTML strings leaving XSS 
protection as the default to protect againts attackers inserting client-side scripts into our web page.


iv. Data flows through the components of the app in a downward fasion. When previous comments are loaded, it begins in the comment box with the 'loadCommentsFromServer' function.... When a new comment is created... When a comment is saved...
v. the nature and purpose of props and state. Which is immutable and which is mutable and why does this distinction matter?



b. Consider the following, more detailed questions based on statements in the tutorial.
i. When adding or removing a comment from the comments.json file, then running the server on the local port 3000,the changes appear on the page within two seconds. This is because the 'polling interval' is set at 2000 miliseconds causing AJAX to reload the components and any possible changes every 2 seconds.


ii. After the CommentBox has loaded comments from ther server via the loadCommentsFromServer() function, it defers to AJAX to control the rendering of the page according to its polling interval (set at 2 seconds). This way the whole page is not re-rednered constantly, but only periodically.
iii. Of what advantage, if any, is it to require that components always represent the current state of the view?
iv. The app implements optimistic updates. Isnâ€™t optimism here more like foolishness? What if the server rejects the new comment (for whatever reason)?
