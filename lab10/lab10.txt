1. Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?

2. You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?

3. You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?

4. For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment (npm run dev)? Why?

5. Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.

6. Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
