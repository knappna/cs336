1. Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?

2. You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?

3. You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?
