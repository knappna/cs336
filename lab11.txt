11.1
a. My development deployment differs from my production deployment in that the development deployment
runs on a dev (development) server while the production deployment does not. While the dev deployment
is designed for development (small scale, many changes, lots of testing), the prod deployment is the
opposite, designed for high scalability in a professional atmosphere.
b. Optimizations:
UglifyJsPlugin - gets rid of whitespace, comments, etc. which take up unnecessary room in production
Removed the development server configuration (because no longer developing)

11.2
a. PasS provides a deployment platform that you don't need to support locally allowing you to run the
app seperate and independently from your loacal server.
b. Heroku is able to recognize common set-ups of applications and so is able to figure out how to
correctly install and run the application you send it. If the application is not recognized by Heroku,
you are able to specify the app set-up in a Procfile.
c. Heroku app URL:https://lab11-knappna.herokuapp.com/
