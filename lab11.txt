11.1
a. My development deployment differs from my production deployment in that the development deployment
runs on a dev (development) server while the production deployment does not. While the dev deployment
is designed for development (small scale, many changes, lots of testing), the prod deployment is the
opposite, designed for high scalability in a professional atmosphere.
b. Optimizations:
UglifyJsPlugin - gets rid of whitespace, comments, etc. which take up unnecessary room in production
Removed the development server configuration (because no longer developing)
