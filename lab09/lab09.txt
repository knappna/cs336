a. What good has this bundling done? How big is the new bundle file? 
Check the Chrome DevTools network log to see what files are being loaded. (ctrl+shift+I)

Bundling has condensed the files into a single file. The new bundle file (dist/bundle.js) is 1.6MB.

b. What role did Babel play in the bundling?
It backwards compiled the JavaScript code (2015+) into an earlier version that is accepted by the google chrome web browser.

c. Can you just load file:///path.../index.html using the browser? Why or why not?
No (it just loads a blank page) because lab09 has now been bundled and condensed so it is not compatable to just be opened
in google chrome.

d. In webpack.config.js, what does the loader test entry test: /\.jsx?$/ do?
It tests to look for jsx notation in files (besides those in the node_modules folder).

9.2
a. Check out the new dist/index.html and dist/bundle.js. How are they different from the previous versions?

Bundle.js is now smaller ( line and 1.3 MB). Index.html is also much smaller and more condensed now, the code is
very short and references bundle.js as the script.

b. What good is it to replace the CDN library loads with module imports?
It prevents you from having to load the libraries at runtime (makes it more efficeint to load the webpage)

c. Check the network log. How many of the new modules you built are being loaded? How about the CSS file?

9.3
a. Try out obth ports and explain the difference between them.
localhost: 3001
localhost: 3000

b. Is it worth all this trouble to build a development configuration?
